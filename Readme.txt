A set of Free ActiveX. Two of them ( Button and ComboEx ) have small improvements. One is pretty new
The ButtonEx ( a Button with Extendend properties ).
What you can do with this Button ?? probably too many. The button can be Transparent or Solid Color
or can have an Image as background.
You can give upto 8 differents appearances (status) for each  situation: without focus , with focus
while mouse is over or while mouse is down or while the drop list is visible, and 2 user conditions.

Yes , this button can have a droplist with upto 10 more buttons. Each of this can have an Icon and
a Caption and a Ptr ( default value are 1...10 ).

Back to the main Button: each status can have its own background and/or icon. If no Icon or image is
defined the default image/icon wil be painted ( if are there). Any properties is available at runtime
and you can modify appearance and working mode while running. As Example you can use it to dispaly a
dinamic menu with the advantage to place it into a toolbar and you can dinamically change Caption and
related value ( using the associated ptrValue ).

I tryed to debug all functionalities...
